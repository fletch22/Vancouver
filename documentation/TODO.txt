TODOs

Each command additions requires the following tasks:

	1. Creation of DTO
	2. Creation of Serializer
	3. Addition to command switch case.
	4. Addition of command service method
	5. Addition of executing service class or method-on-existing-service.
	6. Determination and usage of undo operation.
	
AOP Design: When an Aspect join point executes, the executed methods, params and values (MPVs) will collect in an accumulator.
To create an accumulation of undo operations, call the undo method but in the advice prevent execution of the undo operation. Instead just log the action.
Status: Done
	
Tasks:

	Create Rollback Actions for AddOrbType. - Done
	Add delete instances when deleting type - Done
	Add/Delete attribute - Done 
	Add/Delete/Update Query - Update remains to be finished.
	Add/Delete/Update Constraint -


Given a called command in execution
When command 1 calls command 2
Then command 2 should add to the accumulating actions
And command 2 should add to the accumulating undos.
Status: Done.
	
Given a called command in execution
When command 1 calls command 2
And command 2 throws an exception
Then 1 *and* 2 should roll back.
Status: Done.

Restore mode should be handled at the system level, not the action command level.

Modify change orbType attribute name to also change all references of that name.
Status: Done.

Fix rollback of deleteAttribute;
Status: Done

Determine impact of DirectInvocation operations not having same tranDate as transaction/log operations.
Status: Done. Prop removed from orb. Might add back in future if useful.

Fix 'test delete instance with references'
Status: Done.

Ensure that when attribute is delete all arrows pointing at attribute are set to null (in addition to removing reference).
Status: Done.

Cache creation of queries/query objects.
Status: Done.

Create lookup of attribute index in OrbTypeManager to make setAttribute and other things faster.
Status: Not done.

Add OrbType to constraintDetail so passing it in is unnecessary.
Status: Done.

Make Criteria use label instead of orbinternalId?
Status: Not done.

Optimize CriteriaSpec test to set up data once.
Status: Done.

Modify Queries collection when the following occurs:
	Delete orb - Done.
	Delete attribute - Done.
	Remove attribute - Done.
	
Finish delete dependencies boolean add to all delete methods.
Status: Done.

Fix deleteQuery which calls both deleteOrb and removeQuery. Should not call removeQuery.
Status: Done.

Finish execute query by label returning resultSet.
Status: Done.

Rename "deleteAll" to "nukeAll"
Status: Done.

Add column list to Criteria
Status: Not done.

Add cacheing to CriteriaGrinder. Cache queries based on last update of flag based on orbType. Would need to update tran date for all particular orbType's instances updates 
Status: Not done.

Create tests for QueryAttributeRenameHandler
Status: Done.

Refactor/Extract attributeDeleteHandler to external class (from QueryManager)
Status: Done.

Create tests for attributeDeleteHandler
Status: Done.

Fix delete query on dependencies delete flag == true such that when query is deleted, the processing on it stops.
Status: Done.

Add Uniqeuness index constraint for Query instance Label;
Status: Not done.

Add executeQuery that returns only one result; if over one throw exception.
Status: Done.

Cache constructed Grinder. Replace when query updated.
Status: Not done.

Verify that we should keep checks for LogicalConstraint in methods like 'hasAttribute' in QueryAttributeDeleteHandler.
Status: Not done.

Add in-orb validation/support for query scan validations including unique constraint
Status: Not done.

Add List<Orb> Comparator See QueryManager.findDistinctByAttribute.
Status: Done.

Add uniqueResult() to criteria;
Status: Not done.

Add index initializer in initialization method for each designer object.
Status: Not done.

Test putting logging and rollback into before and after methods;
Status: Not done.

When resetting reference to orb, do not set to null - remove from list if ref value is multi-ref list.
Status: Not done.

Add logic to update or insert depending on id being present in orbComponent. Updates would then update OR insert
Status: Not done.

Create request lifecycle transaction (use @Transaction type annotation to begin wrap?)
Status: Not done.

Add constraint code
Status: Not done.

Add constraint code that limits multi-hop ref chain length.
Status: Not done.

Add constraint code that limits multi-hop circular references.
Status: Not done.

Add kind of removeFromChildren that enforces full orb delete when zero references remain.
Status: Not done.

Add interface to describe aware-of-orbType-delete-event. Then add interface to things like query manager.
Status: Done.

Modify OrbManager to have event handler for orb type delete attr, rename attr, and delete orb type.
Status: Done.

Modify query Manager to event handling like LimitationManager.
Status: Done.

Complete LimitationManager
Status: Done.

Complete: 
// FIXME: 11-12-2014: This is odd. Reconcile with "remove" method.
@Loggable4Event
@Override
public void delete(long criteriaId, boolean isDeleteDependencies) {
	orbManager.deleteOrbIgnoreQueryDependencies(criteriaId, isDeleteDependencies);
	removeFromCollection(criteriaId);
}
Status: Done

Add code that prevents infinite loops on orb and attribute deletion when deleteDependencies is true. This can be accomplished by passing a reference of the item being delete through 
the delete calls. When a delete action detects that the item being examined is the item the process started with, then perform a detach and start deleting "backwards".
Status: Done.

Add code that registers sub queries (known as criteria) so that sub queries can natively respond to Orb action events. When that type of criteria is deleted, 
it's parent must be deleted as well. Find Criteria, for 'add' method, add visitor pattern to handle agg constraint additions and set the parent on the child criteria.
Status: Done.

Allow empty/blank criteria labels in validation
Status: Not done.

Finish attr rename, attr delete, orb delete, and type delete handling 
Status: Done.

Springify Visitors by adding Criteria to parameter list.
Status: Cancelled. Better to make it a non-Spring managed instance class -- needs state.

Replace all StoredProcs with SQL files.
Status: Done for tests.

Rename Criteria to CriteriaImpl then create abstract parent.
Status: Done.

Create CriteriaAggregation and rename CriteriaImpl to CriteriaStandard
Status: Done.

Test can roll back delete inner criteriaAgg.
Status: Done

When default criteria
And No instances
Then user should be able to successfully create one record.
Status: Done.

Create special exception for constraint validation exception.
Status: Not done. See "def 'test criteria unique'() {"

Test criteria aggregate working with custom IndexCollection like the defaultLimitation constraint test does
Status: Done

Startup Doesn't allow clean orb system module initialization; seems to get duplicate IDs -- fix.
Status: Done.

Add Single Threading access. (CommandProcessing?)
Status: Done.

Add transaction handling to open transactions in filter after processing.
Status: Done. But might not be necessary with new aspect.

Fix client side javaScript queue so that order of send is correct.
Status: Done.

Fix client side defaultState - not copying correctly.
Status: Done.

Make special state submitter with diff; server side use diff to update graph;
Status: Need to to create create either a server side java class for diff or use JSONObjects.
