TODOs

Each command additions requires the following tasks:

	1. Creation of DTO
	2. Creation of Serializer
	3. Addition to command switch case.
	4. Addition of command service method
	5. Addition of executing service class or method-on-existing-service.
	6. Determination and usage of undo operation.
	
AOP Design: When an Aspect join point executes, the executed methods, params and values (MPVs) will collect in an accumulator.
To create an accumulation of undo operations, call the undo method but in the advice prevent execution of the undo operation. Instead just log the action.
