Logging and Rolling Back Features:

Recovery Mode:
	Iterating through commands (retrieved) from db should not invoke undo operations. 
	
Transactions can be nested. A nested transaction is AKA a inner transaction.

All IDs for a given transaction nested level have the same tranIds. For example

Transaction OUTER (tranId = 1)
	Operation A (tranId = 1)
	Operation B (tranId = 1)
	Transaction Inner (tranId = 2)
		Operation InnerA (tranId = 2)
		Operation InnerB (tranId = 2)
	Operation C (tranId = 1)
	Operation D (tranId = 1)
	
Nested transaction are kept track of in an array. Peek reads the most recent tran id.

All actions are shuttled through the server ops as a log bundle. This give it context. One bit of context is keeping track of the current id So adding type and instances will set the current internal id.

Since internal ids can be deleted, when a transaction is rolled back the tran id cannot be logically found. In other words:

There are 2 main tables in the log database: actionlog and undoActionLog. To keep things fast and simple, the ActionLog is only two columns: the action and the date of the action. 

Most obviously the tranDate helps us order the commands.
